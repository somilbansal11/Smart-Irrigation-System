# Smart-Irrigation-System
This system is developed to automatically predict when the plant/farm is to be watered. A prototype is designed where three sensors are used for now, (DHT22, Soil Moisture Sensor and RainDrop Module). A Machine Learning is developed too which is trained on the data through these sensors. AWS cloud services are used too to implement the whole system
